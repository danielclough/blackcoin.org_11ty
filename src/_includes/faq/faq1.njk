          <p>
            Did you know that in the United States that cryptocurrency is considered a commodity? So this means you
            get incredible tax breaks! Also many countries do not even tax it. Many people think smart contracts are
            the future! This is like the dawn of the internet.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>Money will never be the same again</span>. So how does this work?
          </p>
          <p>The ability to manage transactions and issue additional BlackCoins is all handled by the network of
              users utilizing BlackCoin. <br />
              So this means <span>YOU are the banker</span>. Because the 
              <span>BlackCoin network is run by the people</span>, holders of BlackCoin, 
              <span>who receive a 1% yearly reward through a process called
                staking</span>.<br />
              BlackCoin is <span>open-source</span> too, meaning that the software that
              makes it function is completely available for public scrutiny giving you peace of mind. 
              <span>No one owns BlackCoin</span>, it is not a single entity; 
              <span>anyone can be a part of it</span>. The bank history is also called a
              "Blockchain". This history is shared by everyone. So when you download the program you save a copy
              of the history and share it! In addition you will stake while the software is running and make sure
              the bank history is secure. So it is <span>impossible to counterfeit</span>.
              Your account is a collection of keys. You can use those keys to sign transactions and evencontracts!
              Nobody else in the world has a copy of those keys, only you. So it is 
              <span>impossible to forge your digital signature</span>. Thanks to the brilliant
              combination of digital signatures and torrents, cryptocurrency has risen to popularity.
          </p>
          <p>So to summarize:</p>
          <p>&#8211;<span>Everyone gets paid to keep the network secure</span><br />
              -Everyone shares the bank history, so <span>its transparent</span><br />
              -The software is open source so you know <span>its safe</span><br />
              &#8211;<span>It is anonymous</span> and anyone can open an account<br />
              &#8211;<span>It is extremely fast</span>, you can send money to anyone in
              the world within minutes<br />
              &#8211;<span>It is</span> and will always BE 
              <span>FREE.</span>

          So <span>what makes Blackcoin so different from Bitcoin?</span>
          </p>
          <p>We love Bitcoin however we also seek to improve on it. 
            <span>Because Bitcoin is so big, it takes too much time for people to agree on innovative changes</span>. This
              is why there was a huge surge in alternative currencies last few years. This has paved the way for
              Blackcoin.<br />
              <span>Blackcoin</span> has continued to lead the way in blockchain
              innovation. <br />
              The coin itself <span>has been forked from Github more than any other coin
                in the world!</span> It was started by Rat4 who worked on mostly POS(Proof of Stake) innovations.
              Rat4 wanted to prove that staking could be <span>secure and more efficient
                than Bitcoins old fashioned and expensive Proof of Work</span>.</p>
            <p>Several members of the community combined the fast POS with a mining pool to help support the
              market price and volume by applying upward pressure and this resulted in a huge rise in Blackcoins
              popularity. Later Rat4 was joined by David Zimbeck the sole creator of 
              <span>BlackHalo</span> who was an active community member. David who was
              previously well known in other fields such as Chess and Entertainment taught himself Python and
              coded a 'Smart Contracting' platform called BitHalo. Because he believed in Rat4 and agreed with the
              security of Blackcoin and the Multipool innovations, David chose to debut Halo in Blackcoin. Because
              of this, <span>Blackcoin was an entire year ahead of other Smart Contracting
                proposals such as Etherium</span>. Rat4 then took to making proof of stake more secure by forcing
              users to interact more with the network and to eliminate some of the security flaws. So he created
              <span>Proof of Stake 2.0</span>. In 2015, Rat4 has started working on a 3.0
              protocol to finally master the protocol. In the meantime, David released a Decentralized Marketplace
              and Decentralized Servers and greatly improved BlackHalo giving it tons of new and exciting features
              focused on user friendliness. All of this was to prepare the coin for the arrival of a 
              <span>Decentralized Exchange built solely on Blackcoin</span>. Since then, many
              other developers have contributed. Drunkonsound, a community member, built and sponsored the exco.in
              exchange as well as several other Blackcoin projects. The exco.in exchange was the first exchange to
              have live, high frequency trading and built with lots of great charting and features for trading.
              Again Blackcoin grew and a new project, Legionairre was also started by a community member, btclaw.
              Legionairre gives people the ability to have <span>Stealth Addresses</span>.
              Their primary focus is your privacy. The momentum in Blackcoin has been continuing and 
              <span>every year more new and exciting features are being added</span>.</p>
            <p>The best part is, if you get involved you can be part of all of the excitement of 
              <span>the future of the internet</span>.

          <p>
            Proof-of-Work was a fantastic innovation that formed the backbone of the original Bitcoin protocol. The
            idea is that by solving a computationally intensive math problem, one can prove the effort they've done
            to secure the protocol. This is how a blockchain is generated, and the effort that is required to
            perform this computations contribute to a coin's scarcity and value. 
          </p>
          <p> 
            However, <span>Proof-of-Work eventually becomes an extraordinarily expensive system</span>.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>Proof of Stake solves this issue</span> in a very elegant way. Rather than
            using computer power as a scarce resource to generate security, Proof of Stake uses the scarcity of the
            coin itself. A user may choose to <span>"stake" his coins to generate the next
              block in the chain</span>, and his chance of doing so is basically proportional to the weight of his
            own coins. 
          </p>
          <p>
            BlackCoin was notably the first coin to use a Proof-of-Work creation cycle followed by transition to
            full Proof-of-stake. <br />
            <span>Proof-of-Stake is eco-friendly and efficient, and avoids the vast waste of
              energy and hardware overhead of Proof-of-Work based networks</span>.<br />
            Over time, BlackCoin's core protocol has made industry-leading improvements to Proof-of-Stake security
            and general functionality (PoS 2.0 and PoS 3.0).

            It is a fixed amount of BLK due to <span>static block reward</span>, and a
            slightly less inflation rate year on year because of that.
          </p>
          <p>
            The block time target is 67 seconds, so working that out per year (60/67 x 60) x 24 x 365 is 470686
            block rewards (1.5BLK) in a year which is <span>706,030 new BLK per year
              roughly.</span> As of right now, 706,030 is 1.172% of the total supply of 60,238,885 BLK.
          </p>
          <p>
            This 1.172% is distributed to only fraction of the shareholders, the ones who stake. 
            <span>The reward rate is way above 1%, average to 4-8% annual depending on time and amount of BLK staked.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            That means if only 20% of coins were being actively staked, you could actually get around 5%/year for
            continually staking, since 80% of people (avg) weren't staking and get nothing.

            Blackcoin is a pure PoS (Proof-of-Stake) coin and can no longer be mined in the usual way. However, you

            <span>secure the network</span> and aid in the various transactions made for all

            Once you start to Stake, you will notice that a certain amount of coins will be placed into your Stake
