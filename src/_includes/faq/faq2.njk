            The current bootstrap is around 2.0 GB. It can take a long time to download (
            pan>depending on your internet speed and available peers</span>). 
          </p>
          <p>  
            Downloading the bootstrap is a good way to speed up your first syncing when you use the Blackcoin Legacy wallet. <br />
            You can find BLK Bootstrap at the bottom of the page (FAQ/OTHER/BOOTSTRAP).

          <p>   
          wever you can help the wallet with giving it a list of nodes:
          </p>
          <p>   
            To apply addnode, you have to find your blackcoin.conf (Legacy) or blackmore.conf (More). It should be
          here: <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            Windows: %APPDATA%\blackcoin\<br />
          or %APPDATA%\blackmore\<br />
          Linux: $HOME/.blackcoin/<br />
          or $HOME/.blackmore/<br />
          Mac OSX: $HOME/Library/Application Support/blackcoin/<br />
          or $HOME/Library/Application Support/blackmore/<br />
          </p>
          <p>
            Then go to https://chainz.cryptoid.info/blk/#!network<br />
          Click on "node list"<br />
          Copy the whole list to the end of the .conf<br />
          Start Blackcoin <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            * Sometimes OS hides file extensions so check if a .conf is not actually .conf.txt<br />
          </p>
          <p>
            If you still receiving problems, check your debug.log, look for errors and ask on Blackcoin Discord

            HOW TO SEND BLACKCOIN?

        </h4>
        <div class="panel-body">
          <p>
            To send coins is very straight forward. <br />
            If you are sending these coins to a friend, exchange or business, then all you will need is their 
            <span>Receive address</span> (known as a deposit address on exchanges).<br />
            If your wallet is encrypted, which hopefully it is, you will also need to have your 
            <span>passphrase</span> (encryption phrase) ready as this is required every time you
            want to send coins out of your wallet. <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>Pay To:</span> Enter the Blackcoin address of your friend/exchange or
            business. (These addresses will also be stored in your built-in address book, where you can label or
            re-label whenever you wish) <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>Label:</span> This makes it easier for you to remember who the address
          belong to, so if you send to an exchange like say Bittrex, type in Bittrex exchange. <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>Amount:</span> How much you want to send. <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            Please note that if you are sending coins to an address, make sure that you 
            <span>copy and paste the address</span> in to the Pay To area instead of typing it
            in. <br />
            This will hopefully prevent you from entering an incorrect address.

            HOW TO RECEIVE BLACKCOINS?

        </h4>
        <div class="panel-body">
          <p>
            Like sending coins, receiving them is just as simple. <br />
            If you have just bought some BlackCoins from an exchange, or are being paid in BLK then you will need to
            have a Receive Address so that the coins can be sent straight to your wallet.
            <br /> By default you will only have one <span>Receive Address</span>, so just
            right-click on it and select <span>Copy Address</span>. This prevents from
            trying to manually type it out and making errors.
            <br />Now <span>give that address to whoever wishes to pay you (or
            exchange)</span>. <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            You dont have to use the same address to receive coins for every transaction as 
            <span>creating a new address is very simple</span>. <br />
            Just <span>click New Address at the bottom and then label it whatever you
              wish</span> (eg. Donation from site) so you can view individual transaction made to you easier over
            time.
